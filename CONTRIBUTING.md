# How to contribute

[Mono](http://openmono.com) is an open hardware product, so of course all
accompanying applications are open source, which means you are more than
welcome to contribute with improvements or new funtionality.

## Branches

Development happens on the master branch, so that is where we accept pull
requests.

## Formatting

 - Avoid inline comments.
 - Break long lines.
 - Delete trailing whitespace.
 - Do not vertically align tokens on consecutive lines.
 - If you break up a delimited list, keep delimiters and each argument on their
   own lines.
 - Use tabs for indentation.
 - Use Unix-style line endings.
