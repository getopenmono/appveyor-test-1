Feature: Application will detect Mono device
	To know if Mono is connected correctly to computer
	As a maker
	I want the application to indicate whether or not it can connect to Mono.

	Scenario Outline: Application invoked with detect argument
		When I run `monoprog --mock disconnected <arg>`
		Then the output should contain "Mono device not detected on USB port"
		And the exit status should be 2

		Examples:
			| arg      |
			| -d       |
			| --detect |

		And the exit status should be 0

		Examples:
			| arg      |
			| -d       |
